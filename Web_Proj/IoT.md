####Internet of Things (IoT) and Communication Interfaces

About:
--The Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept where everyday objects and devices are connected to the internet, enabling them to collect, share, and act on data. This connectivity allows these devices to provide automation, enhance user experiences, and perform intelligent tasks with minimal human intervention. IoT devices range from home appliances like smart speakers to wearable tech like fitness trackers.





How Devices Connect + Examples:
-- Bluetooth - short-range wireless tech that connects devices within abt 10 meters. Energy effecient, good for transfer of small amt of data.
     - Fitness trackers
     - Smartphones
     - Computers

-- NFC - Short-range (works over a few cm) for contactless communication 
    - Contactless payment (Ex: Apple Pay)

-- Wi-Fi - Medium-range connection via local router. High speed transfer.
    - Smart speaker (Alexa)
    - Wearable Tech

-- LTE - Cellular network tech that provides mobile broadband access allowing devices to connect to internet without Wi-Fi.
    - Smart Speakers
    - Wearable Tech

Topics to Explore:
-- IoT and protocols:
    - IPv6: Underlying addressing system that allows devices to communicate over the internet. Require unique IP address, communicate directly, low power and mobility support
    - HTTP/HTTPS: protocols used for communication between devices and servers, primarily for web-based interactions. Used to send/retrieve data from cloup platforms, secure info.
-- IoT and Web Servers:
    - IoT interfaces like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and others enable IoT devices to communicate with web servers for data exchange, remote control, and integration with cloud-based applications.
-- IoT and Performance:
    - IoT devices impact internet speed and performance by increasing network traffic, consuming bandwidth, and potentially causing latency and congestion, especially in areas with limited capacity or high device density. Devices like smart cameras and sensors continuously send or stream data, which can strain networks and reduce performance for other applications. However, advancements like edge computing and lightweight communication protocols (e.g., MQTT) help mitigate these effects by reducing data sent to the cloud and optimizing bandwidth use. To minimize disruptions, strategies such as upgrading to high-speed internet, prioritizing traffic with Quality of Service (QoS), and adopting efficient protocols can ensure IoT devices coexist without significantly affecting overall network performance.
-- IoT and Browsers:
    - Browsers play a vital role in managing IoT data by providing user-friendly interfaces for monitoring, controlling, and configuring devices. They allow users to access web-based dashboards to visualize data, analyze trends, and remotely control IoT devices, such as adjusting a thermostat or checking security camera feeds. Through integration with cloud platforms, browsers enable seamless management of multiple devices and advanced features like automation. They also ensure secure access with protocols like HTTPS and authentication mechanisms, protecting sensitive data. Additionally, browsers are often used for initial setup and configuration of IoT devices, making them an essential tool for interacting with IoT ecosystems.
